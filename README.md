Hi there 👋 I’m Mayuresh Mistry

👀 I’m interested in programming, constantly learning new technologies, diving into the world of VFX (visual effects), and, of course, gaming!

🌱 I’m currently learning Python for scripting and development, and actively exploring different APIs to work with for various applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative coding projects, game jams, or anything that blends technology with visual storytelling.

📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayureshmistry/ or email me at mayureshmistry6@gmail.com.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: My favorite part about VFX is making the impossible look real, and I'm always up for a good strategy game!
